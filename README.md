# <Password-Generator>

## Description

This application was made to generate passwords for multiple users to use for their accounts. I learned a lot about loops and appending items to strings in this activity. I ran into multiple problems trying to get my encrypted password out of my while loop, but I realized that it was my return statements taking me out of my loop prematurely.


## Usage

Use this application to create a secure password for your account(s). Just click the generate button and follow the prompts, your password will be displayed in the middle.
